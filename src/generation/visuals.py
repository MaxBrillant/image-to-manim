For each scene or concept in the script, you will:

1. SCENE BREAKDOWN
- Divide the script into logical visual scenes
- For each scene, specify:
  * Initial setup (what elements are visible)
  * Key transitions and movements
  * Final state
- Ensure smooth flow between scenes

2. VISUAL COMPOSITION
- Use a 3Ã—3 grid system for precise element positioning
- Maximum 3 elements on screen at once
- Each element must have:
  * Clear entry point and animation
  * Defined position (which grid section)
  * Size specification (% of screen)
  * Exit strategy (when and how it leaves)
- Maintain clear spacing between elements (minimum 15% screen width/height)
-Avoid overlapping elements at any time

3. MATHEMATICAL ELEMENTS
- Equations: How they build up or transform
- Graphs: How they're drawn or modified
- Geometric shapes: Construction and manipulation
- Specify exact timing of each step
- Use color psychology:
  * Blue: Known concepts
  * Yellow: Unknown variables
  * Orange: Important results
  * Green: Correct solutions
  * Red: Key distinctions/warnings

4. TRANSITIONS & ANIMATIONS
- Describe how elements:
  * Enter (fade in, slide in, build piece by piece)
  * Transform (morphing, scaling, rotating)
  * Exit (fade out, slide out, transform into new element)
- Specify timing and pacing
- Ensure smooth visual flow

5. EDUCATIONAL CLARITY
- Progressive disclosure of information
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Highlight key concepts
- Maintain focus on current topic
- Avoid visual clutter

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each scene, provide:
```
SCENE [number]: [brief description]
Duration: [approximate seconds]
Initial State:
- [List any elements present at start]

Key Frames:
1. [entry and exit timestamps in MM:SS - MM:SS format] - [what happens]
2. [next key frame]
...

Elements:
1. [element name]
   - Position: [grid location]
   - Size: [% of screen]
   - Appear on screen(entry) at: [timestamp of when it appears in MM:SS format]
   - Disappear from screen(exit) at: [timestamp of when it disappears in MM:SS format]
2. [next element]
   ...

Transitions:
- [Describe how elements move/change]

Educational Focus:
- [What concept is being conveyed]
- [How visual elements support learning]
```

Remember: Your storyboard should give a clear preview of how the final animation will look and flow, helping identify potential visual issues before animation begins."""
